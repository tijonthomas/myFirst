difference between git fetch and git pull?
git fetch only downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files. Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository.
Due to it's "harmless" nature, you can rest assured: fetch will never manipulate, destroy, or screw up anything.

git pull, is used with a different goal in mind: to update your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. This means that pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.
